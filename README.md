# Hello World TDD

A simple REST API made in Node + <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a> wich basically is a CRUD with 3 entities: course, teacher and student.

That's also my first project with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.

# How To Run
To run, just type the following commands on the root folder of project:

    $ npm i
    $ node index.js
    
You can also use <a href="https://nodemon.io/">nodemon</a>. Just type:

    $ nodemon
    
To make the requests, use <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.
